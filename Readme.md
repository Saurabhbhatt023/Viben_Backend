Key improvements made:

Added compound index for efficient querying of requests
Added pre-save validation to prevent self-connections
Created a method to generate status messages with user names
Enhanced status validation
Added pagination and filtering to the received requests endpoint
Improved error handling and response messages
Added authorization check for request updates
Added detailed comments explaining the code
Implemented proper status message generation

The code now handles connection requests more robustly and provides better user feedback through status messages. The compound index will improve query performance when checking for existing requests.
Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail or help with implementing additional features?
